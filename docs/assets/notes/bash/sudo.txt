echo password | sudo -S rm -rf /opt/jetty/

/*
In the command above we are trying to remove the /opt/jetty directory using the rm -rf command. The -S (stdin) option allow the sudo command to read password from a standard input instead of a terminal device.

If you want to store the password in a file you can use the cat command instead of echo like the following example.

cat password.txt | sudo -S rm -rf /opt/jetty/
