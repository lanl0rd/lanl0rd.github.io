Add It To Crontab
By now, you should have a script that looks something like this.
#! /bin/bash

#
# Home Directory Backup Script
#
tar --listed-incremental=/media/backup/snapshot.file -cJpf /media/backup/home-backup-`date +%d-%m-%Y`.tar.xz /home/user/{Documents,Downloads,Pictures,Music,.config,.Xresources,.xinitrc,.i3,.mozilla,.zshrc}
Be sure to make the script executable.
$ chmod +X /home/user/home-backup.sh
If you're happy with that, you can move on to creating the crontablinux command as root.
# crontab -u username -e
An editor(probably nano) will open up for you to add your line. When you're done, it'll look something like this one.
0 3 * * * /home/user/home-backup.sh
