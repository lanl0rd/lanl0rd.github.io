FUCKKKKKKKKKK vino server is a bitch about network connection it allows by default, the below didnt work but some of it might be useful

/* in fact with new versions of ubuntu i see that you can just go to remote sharing and set a password and enable it for the current network, the only problem seems to be that when you hop networks you have to some how set the preferences again! looks like there is a dynamic way to do that, stay tuned */

sooooo as long as xforwarding is on in ssh server /etc/ssh/sshd_config,  ssh -Y user@server 
then you can type gnome-control-center 
this will launch the settings app (only tested this on a fellow ubuntu machine)!! you can then change the settings!

/* the below wasnt very fruitful */
apt install -y vino dconf-editor

Method 1 :
This can be achieved with vino vnc server & remmina (both come default with ubuntu; if not install it by running sudo apt-get install remmina). Then Run Following commands from local computer in terminal prompt:

ssh -Y gman@remote. Use trusted X11 forwarding, otherwise it wont work

vino-preferences. It will open vino-preferences.

vino-preference

Also Click configure network automatically to accept connection. But don't enter any password, its base64 encoded. Then click close. Then run:

sudo -s

export DISPLAY=:0.0

xhost +

/usr/lib/vino/vino-server & 
It will start the vino server.

Logout from server:

xhost -

Press CTRL+C twice

exit

exit
Then open remmina. Choose vnc under protocol.

Under basic tab put server address in server field.

On ssh tab click enable ssh tunnel. Under ssh authentication, it could be password or public key:

remmina-preference

Click save. And then double click connection-name(home-desktop as shown in the picture) to start browsing remote desktop.

Method 2:
x11vnc is a simple VNC server and you won't have to mess around with Gnome settings or 500 firewalls, just install x11vnc on all your computers (with puppet or whatever you're using for mass-control).

Then from your local computer run:

ssh user@host -L 5900:localhost:5900 "x11vnc -display :0 -noxdamage"
Obviously swapping user@host for the username and hostname/IP of the remote computer.
And then use a VNC client of your choice to connect to localhost:5900. The SSH command starts a vnc server on the remote computer and then tunnels back that port over SSH. You don't have to open up any ports (as long as you can already SSH).
If your computers have funny display settings, you might do better to leave off the -display :0 segment in the SSH command. x11vnc will then automatically try to find the right display.


/* steps to be able to vnc (may not be necessary anymore with above steps) */
/*
vnc viewer app on mac
(should also probably get remote desktop for windows hosts)
go into ubuntu settings and make sure under sharing that screen sharing is on for the network (so set it up with wired and it will always work wherever its plugged in, still trying to find a way to have it universally trust the wan setup!!)
also its gonna be annoying if you have to be watching the screen prompt for allowing connections, a little easier to just set up a password like password
after openining vnc viewer create a new connection with (what is hopefully a static ip on the host, you can set that up fairly easily by going to network, configure it to be static and choose a 192.168.0.x with usually the gateway as 192.168.0.1)
youll probably if run into:
Unable to connect to VNC Server using your chosen security setting. Either upgrade VNC Server to a more recent version from RealVNC, or select a weaker level of encryption.
*/

gsettings set org.gnome.Vino require-encryption false

/*
should work now with a message about it being not super secure, vnc protocol runs on port 5900 by default.... need to figure out a "secure" way to do this, probably ssh first or something
so i read that you could try to do the secure way like:
*/

ssh -L 5959:127.0.0.1:5900 simba@192.168.0.119

/*
which from there i went to vnc and connected to localhost:5959 instead, which worked, but, it seems that its still unsecure, perhaps because i didnt use keys or something when ssh

apprently -C compresses -R is for a reverse tunnel, and theres a few other ssh options like -X for unsecure x server and -Y for secure
