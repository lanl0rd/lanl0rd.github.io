you can make a running container an image! so this is useful if you dont want to make a dockerfile or you cannot remember all the steps or its hard to do all the steps in one RUN command...

So for instance, you can start with a base image (ubuntu), run commands like apt-get update, install curl, then you can make this the new latest version of ubuntu!


docker ps

take the id of the container you want to make as the new version.


docker container commit 123 ubuntu:latest



thats all!
